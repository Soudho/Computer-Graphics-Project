Setup: The game utilizes OpenGL, which is a graphics library used for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. It provides functions for drawing basic shapes, lines, and points on a window.

Drawing Functions: Various functions were implemented to draw different elements of the game, such as the tank, bullets, houses, roads, and buttons. These functions use OpenGL primitives like points, lines, and circles to render the shapes.

Game Logic: The game logic includes functionalities like moving the tank, firing bullets, updating the state of the houses (representing targets), managing scores, and controlling fast travel options. These functionalities are implemented using Python code.

User Interaction: The game allows users to control the tank using keyboard and mouse inputs. Special keyboard and mouse listener functions were implemented to handle user commands for moving the tank and firing bullets.

Animations and Timers: The game includes animations for various actions, such as firing bullets and looting houses. Timers are used to control the timing of these animations and game events.

Score and Game Over: The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen. When certain conditions are met, such as hitting all targets or running out of fast travel options, the game ends, and a game-over screen is displayed.

Restart and Pause: Options for restarting the game and pausing/resuming gameplay are provided through buttons on the screen. These functionalities are implemented using mouse listener functions.

Overall, the game is built by combining OpenGL for graphics rendering and Python for implementing game logic and user interaction. It offers a simple yet engaging gameplay experience with shooting targets using a tank.
